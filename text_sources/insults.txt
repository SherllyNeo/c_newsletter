Doorknob licker 
Walking prokaryote 
You’re not the dumbest person in the world, but you better pray they don’t die 
You look easy to rob 
you look easy to draw 
your voice somehow sounds grating and droll at the same time 
you’re really pretty from a distance 
Look at that outfit! look who’s ready for a night at home! 
meh. 
you’re like a 10 year old man in a 12 year old girl’s body 
if you were a horse, I’d shoot you 
you should just always wear sports attire cause you’re so used to being played 
I understand your insecurities. If I were you, I would also be insecure
thank you for representing people who aren’t conventionally attractive
Someday you’ll go far. And I really hope you stay there.
You’re the reason God created the middle finger.
You’re a gray sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake.
Your secrets are always safe with me. I never even listen when you tell me them.
You bring everyone so much joy! You know, when you leave the room. 
I hope your husband brings a date to your funeral
You are more disappointing than finding out I can't sleep in the nether
It’s impossible to underestimate you.
Wow, your God really didn’t waste time trying to give you a personality.
I’ll never forget the first time we met. But I’ll keep trying.
I’m not insulting you, I’m describing you.
You are like a cloud. When you disappear, it’s a beautiful day.
I’m not a nerd. I’m just smarter than you.
You have miles to go before you meet mediocre.
I thought of you today. It reminded me to take out the bin.
 You look so pretty today. Yesterday was a nightmare.
 Somewhere out there is a tree tirelessly producing oxygen for you. You owe it an apology.
 Mirrors can’t talk. Lucky for you, they can’t laugh, either.
 You are proof God has a sense of humor.
 Grab a straw, because you suck.
 Don’t be ashamed of who you are. That’s your parent’s job.
 I told my therapist about you.
 you’re the human version of a participation trophy.
 If I throw a stick, will you fetch?
 I bet your parents change the subject when their friends ask about you.
 You’re a conversation starter. Once you leave.
